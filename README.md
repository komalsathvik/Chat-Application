# Chat-Application
ðŸš€ Just Launched My Real-Time Chat Application! ðŸ’¬

Super excited to share my latest project â€” a real-time chat app built using React, WebSockets, and Socket.IO! This project taught me a lot about handling live data, rooms, and most importantly â€” CORS challenges in a production environment ðŸ˜….

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

Real-time messaging using WebSockets

Room-based chat functionality

Smooth UI with React

CORS configuration for cross-origin communication

ðŸ”— Live Demo: https://chat-application-t4vi.vercel.app/

ðŸ’» GitHub Repo: https://github.com/komalsathvik/Chat-Application

Thanks to Socket.IO, managing real-time bi-directional communication became much easier, and working through CORS policies in deployment environments like Render and Vercel was a great learning experience.

Check it out and let me know your thoughts! ðŸ˜Š
